# WESR Triquest — Governance
WESR Triquest is an open, non-profit rule set stewarded by Triquest with decisions made by a Community Council. The project is neutral and evidence-driven.
## Principles
- Transparency, safety first, compatibility with EN/IEC/ISO and GWO where applicable.
- Minimal bureaucracy; public traceability of changes; inclusivity and respect.
## Bodies
- **Steward (Triquest):** facilitates releases, maintains site/repo, assures Change of Record quality.
- **Community Council:** reviews proposals, considers evidence and pilots, decides: Approve / Approve with changes / Reject.
- **Maintainers:** subject-area reviewers (HV, LV, CoHE, Training).
## Process
1. Issue → public PR with references and impact analysis.
2. Public review 2–4 weeks (shorter for urgent safety).
3. Council decision recorded; steward merges/releases.
4. CoR + version bump in CHANGELOG.
## Conflicts of interest
Members disclose conflicts and recuse where relevant.
## Appeals
Submit an appeal as an issue referencing the decision; council responds publicly.
