Scope & Applicability \nThe Combined Rulebook governs all work and operations within the WESR boundary, covering \nelectrical HV and LV activities and Control of Hazardous Energy (COHE) for all energy forms \n(mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal, gravitational, stored/latent). It stitches \ntogether the standalone rules and add‑ons to provide one point of navigation and precedence. \nIn scope: WESR‑controlled sites, onshore/offshore, employees/contractors/visitors. \n \n2. Hierarchy & Precedence \n1) Applicable law & site rules (most stringent). \n \n2) This Combined Rulebook (WESR‑CRB) — top‑level governance and navigation. \n \n3) Discipline Standards: \no WESR‑HV‑OPS — High‑Voltage Operating Rules (HV). \n \no WESR‑LV‑OPS — Lov-Voltage Operating Rules (LV)(≤ 1 kV AC / ≤ 1.5 kV DC). \n \no WESR‑COHE — Control of Hazardous Energy (all energy types). \n \no WESR‑ESI — Electrical Shock Instruction. \n \no WESR‑EIR — Electrical Injury Response & Reporting. \n \no WESR‑LI‑PROC — Lockout Instruction Process. \n \n4) Local procedures and manufacturer instructions. \nRule of more stringent control: If two requirements conflict, the more stringent shall apply. \n \n3. Roles & Single‑Point‑of‑Control \n• PCEI — Person in Control of the Electrical Installation: owns operational control of the \nelectrical installation outside normal service, issues/controls Safety Documents \n(PTW/SfT/AA) until restoration. \n \n• D‑PCEI — Delegate: written delegation for a bounded area/time. \n \n \n4 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n• PCWA — Person in Charge of Work Activity: owns the workface, boundaries, on‑site risk \nreview (RISK‑W), team briefing, and clearance. \n \n• HV Switching Assistant (HV‑SA): assists PCEI during HV switching and earthing with \norder/confirmation protocol. \n \n• Isolation Lead (IL) / Isolation Verifier (IV) / Lock User (LU): COHE lockout roles with \nindependence rule IL ≠ IV; LU applies personal lock. \n \n• Test Lead (HV‑TL): leads technical execution under SfT/TEP when \ntesting/commissioning. \nSingle‑point‑of‑control: For any affected installation part, there is exactly one PCEI (or D‑PCEI) \nin control at a time. Handovers are recorded. \n \n4. Operating Model & Statuses (Universal) \nDefault principle: Dead/zero‑energy working. Live/energised work is exceptional and requires \njustification, authorisation, and a TEP/SfT when primary precautions vary. \nStan",

    "text": "Interpretation Rules (v1.0) \nDocument Code: WESR‑RG v1.0 \nOwner: PREI \nPrepared by: Triquest Learning \nEffective Date: TBC \nSupersedes: — \nApplies to: All WESR rule sets and their Requirements‑for‑Training (RFT) documents \n \n1. Purpose \nThis Reading Guide governs how to interpret, implement, and audit all WESR \nRequirements‑for‑Training (RFT) documents. It defines wording, applicability, traceability, and \nassessment/evidence expectations to ensure providers and auditors read requirements the \nsame way. \n2. Normative vs Informative \n• Normative (shall/must): mandatory, auditable minimum requirements. \n \n• Informative (notes/examples): explanatory material; not auditable unless adopted into \nprovider procedures. \n3. Wording Hierarchy \n• Shall / Must — mandatory. \n \n• Should — recommended; deviations require written justification and risk rationale. \n \n• May / Can — optional or allowed. \n \n• Note / Example — informative only. \n4. Scope & Applicability Logic \nApply by Rule Set (HV‑OPS, LV‑OPS, COHE, ESI, EIR, LI‑PROC), Role (PCEI, D‑PCEI, PCWA, IL, \nIV, LU, HV‑SA, HV‑TL, PREI), Site context (on/offshore), and Task type (dead work, vicinity, \ntesting, lockout, access). Where two rules conflict, apply the more stringent control. For mixed \nsystems, apply the rule set for the highest hazard unless systems are physically segregated. \n5. Identification & Traceability Rules \n• Every requirement, learning objective (LO), assessment item, and evidence type has a \nunique ID. \n \n• Cross‑reference model: Clause → Topic → LO → Content → Assessment → Evidence → \nRole(s). \n \n• Use controlled IDs for forms and safety documents (e.g., LI‑HE‑001, ILOR‑HE‑001, \nGLSS‑HE‑001, SIBA‑HE‑001, APLR‑HE‑001, RISK‑W‑HE‑001, TEP‑HE‑001, EDC‑HE‑001). \n \n• RFTs shall embed a Matrix K1 implementing the cross‑reference model. \n6. Outcome Taxonomy & LO Structure \nEach LO includes: ID, Verb, Condition, Standard, Clause Ref(s), Role(s). Verbs must be \nmeasurable and paired with condition + performance standard. Example: Given a multi‑energy \nsystem and an approved template, produce a complete LI listing all isolation points and \nstored‑energy controls with zero omissions. \n7. Content Depth & Illustration Rules \nContent requirements specify depth per topic (Shall/Should/May) and any mandatory \nillustrations/diagrams (placeholders are allowed but content intent is mandatory). Where \nfigures depict safety‑critical steps, they shall include labels and callouts. \n8. Practical Training & Scenario Design \nPracticals define task, setup/inputs, hazard controls, steps, failure modes to provoke, \nacceptance criteria, evidence. Where independence is required (e.g., IL vs IV), roles shall be \nseparated and recorded as such. \n9. Assessment Governance \n• Theory: blueprint‑based exam; pass mark ≥ 80%. \n \n• Practical: rubric‑based with observable behaviors and critical errors (any critical error = \nfail). \n \n• Re‑test policy: Failure of theory (<80%) or any critical error requires course retake. \nSame",

    "text": "and recorded as such. \n9. Assessment Governance \n• Theory: blueprint‑based exam; pass mark ≥ 80%. \n \n• Practical: rubric‑based with observable behaviors and critical errors (any critical error = \nfail). \n \n• Re‑test policy: Failure of theory (<80%) or any critical error requires course retake. \nSame‑day re‑attempt may be permitted for non‑critical errors at assessor discretion \n(single station). \n \n• Assessor independence: Practical assessors shall be competent and calibrated; IL and \nIV for the same scenario should not be signed by a single assessor. \n10. Evidence Model & Learner Records \nMandatory artifacts: attendance, theory score report, signed practical rubrics, copies of all \ncompleted forms (e.g., LI/ILOR/GLSS/APLR/SIBA/TEP/RISK‑W/EDC), photos/video where \nspecified, participant end‑of‑training acknowledgement with complaint option, and assessor \nnotes. All artifacts shall be date‑stamped, ID‑linked, and tamper‑evident in the record system. \n11. Role Filters & Variants \nRole‑specific extracts are created by filtering Matrix K1; IDs must remain stable. Providers may \nnot remove mandatory elements for a role even if another role’s variant omits them. \n12. Equivalency / Credit Transfer \nCredit may be granted only where providers hold a documented mapping from prior training to \neach LO, assessment, and evidence type; mapping evidence joins the learner’s record. \n13. Standards Scope (Normative Families) \nRFTs shall reference EU/IEC/ISO standards only (unless an RFT explicitly extends scope). \nFamilies typically include: EN 50110‑1 (operation of electrical installations), EN ISO 14118 \n(prevent unintended start), EN ISO 14119 (interlocking devices), ISO 12100 (risk), ISO 13849‑1 \n(safety‑related parts), ISO 4413/4414 (hydraulic/pneumatic fluid power), IEC 60204‑1 (electrical \nequipment of machines), IEC/EN 60900 (insulated tools), EN 60903 (gloves), IEC 61482‑2 (arc \nPPE), ISO 7010 (safety signs), EU Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230. RFTs shall list the exact \neditions they rely on. \n14. Change Management & Versioning \nUse semantic versioning vMajor.Minor.Patch. Record changes in the Change‑of‑Record table \nwith reason and risk note. Safety‑critical corrections may be released as errata with immediate \neffect. \n15. Audit Method \nAuditors assess conformance by sampling Matrix K1 links end‑to‑end: requirement → LO → \ncontent → assessment → evidence → role. Non‑conformities are graded Minor / Major / Critical \nwith defined correction timelines and re‑audit triggers. \n16. Nomenclature & Definitions (“Ananometer” Section) \nThis section defines terms and abbreviations used across WESR RFTs so that auditors interpret \nwording consistently. \nCore abbreviations \n- PREI — Process Responsible Electrical Individual. \n- PCEI / D‑PCEI — Person in Charge of Electrical Installation / Delegated. \n- PCWA — Person in Control of Work Area. \n- IL / IV — Isolation Leader / Isolation Verifier. \n- LU — Lockout User. \n- LI / ILOR / GLSS / SIBA / APLR / TEP / RISK‑W",

Purpose and Scope \nThis add‑on defines minimum requirements to control hazardous energy during installation, \ncommissioning, operation, service, maintenance and dismantling of plant and equipment. It \nintegrates with WESR roles, processes and safety documents and supersedes baseline WESR \nwhere this add‑on is more stringent. Local law and site rules that are more stringent take \nprecedence. \nApplicability: - All personnel performing tasks where unexpected energisation, start‑up, \nmovement or release of hazardous energy could cause harm. \n- All sites and facilities operating under WESR, including customer and contractor activities \nwithin the WESR‑controlled boundary. \n- Interfaces with non‑electrical trades and external parties where COHE risk exists. \nWritten Program: \nEach site must maintain a written COHE program aligned with this add‑on and local law. Map \nany regional/international standard used to the roles/competence in this add‑on; identify and \nclose gaps. \n \n2. Principles & Accountability \n• Zero‑energy is the default. Isolate, dissipate, verify, and lockout before work. \n \n• Competence & equipment: Only competent persons with suitable tools/PPE may \nperform COHE activities; required hardware is provided and maintained. \n \n• Management accountability: PREI and delegates ensure implementation, competence, \nequipment provision and audit. \n \n• Stop‑work authority: Any person may refuse/stop work if controls are inadequate. \n \n3. COHE Program Under WESR (Governance & Roles) \nRoles (mapped to WESR): - PREI — Owns the site COHE program; appoints the PCEI; approves \nlocal procedures and deviations. \n- PCEI — Controls the installation; plans/approves isolations; issues Safety Documents (e.g., \nPTW) and retains control until restoration. \n- D‑PCEI — Delegated control for a defined area/time; acts under PCEI governance. \n- PCWA — Controls the work activity; performs on‑site risk review (RISK‑W); sets supplementary \nmeasures; briefs team; clears Safety Document. \n \n3 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 COPYRIGHT TRIQUEST \n \n- Isolation Lead (IL) — Person in charge of the lockout for the task; executes the isolation plan; \napplies primary locks/tags; completes the Isolation & Lockout Record; coordinates group \nlockout. \n- Isolation Verifier (IV) — Independent verifier performing the four‑eyes check on isolation \npoints, tag/lock IDs, and zero‑energy verification. IL and IV must be different people. \n- Lock User (LU) — Worker applying a personal lock at the group lock station; signs on/off; works \nunder PCWA control. \nSafety Documents used for COHE: \n- PTW — Permit‑to‑Work (default for dead/zero‑energy work). \n- TEP — Test & Energisation Plan (used with a Sanction for Test where primary precautions vary). \n- AA — Access Agreement (for non‑electrical tasks with residual energy risk near safeguarded \nareas). \n- Lockout Instruction (LI‑H",

Competence, Training & Authorisation \n• IL & IV: Skilled/competent for the energy type(s) involved; practically assessed to isolate, \ndissipate and verify zero energy. \n \n• PCWA: Competent to set work boundaries, adjacent‑hazard controls, and manage team \nbriefings and suspensions. \n \n• PCEI/D‑PCEI: Appointed in writing with defined control areas. \n \n• LU: Instructed and briefed; applies/removes own personal lock only. \n \n• Retraining & re‑authorisation: Periodic refreshers; event‑driven re‑authorisation after \nincidents, long absence, equipment upgrades, or procedure changes. Practical \nassessment must include complex/group lockout and zero‑energy verification. \n \n5.

HV/LV \nboundary is defined per installation (see Section 12). \n \n• Single point of control: The PCEI retains control of the installation whenever it is not in \nnormal service. \n \n2. Roles & Responsibilities (HV) \n• PREI — Owns HV governance, appoints PCEI, approves high‑risk deviations and \ncompetence frameworks. \n \n• PCEI (Person in Control of the Electrical Installation) — Overall control of HV \ninstallation; plans/verifies switching & primary safety measures; issues and controls \nSafety Documents until restoration. \n \n• D‑PCEI (Delegate) — Written delegation of HV control tasks for defined plant/period. \n \n• PCWA (Person in Charge of Work Activity) — Controls the work; conducts RISK‑W at \nthe workplace; sets supplementary measures; briefs team; clears the Safety Document. \n \n• Switching Assistant (HV‑SA) — Competent person assisting PCEI/D‑PCEI during HV \nswitching/earthing; reads back orders and records confirmations. \n \n \n4 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n \n• Skilled/Instructed/Ordinary Persons — As per EN person categories; mapped to WESR \ncompetence (Section 11). \n \n• Test Lead (HV‑TL) — For sanctioned testing; leads technical execution under SfT/TEP, \ncoordinates with PCEI. \nIndependence rules: \n- HV switching/earthing requires order/confirmation and two‑person control (PCEI + HV‑SA or \nequivalent). \n- The PCWA is independent from PCEI in exercising work control; conflicts resolved in favour of \nsafety. \n \n3.

Issued by \nPCEI/D‑PCEI to PCWA after isolation/earthing/verification are confirmed. \n \n• SfT (Sanction for Test) — Required where testing/commissioning demands varied \nprimary precautions or temporary energisation; exclusivity applies (no parallel permits on \nsame equipment). \n \n• Access Agreement (AA‑HV) — For non‑electrical work in HV areas with residual \nelectrical risk (e.g., near barriers/earthing). \n \n• Switching Schedule (SS‑HV) — Authorised, stepwise plan for switching, isolation, \nearthing and restoration with four‑eyes review. \nAll Safety Documents bear unique IDs, issue/version, time stamps, signatures and explicit \nboundaries. \n \n4. Operating Principles & Distances \n• Dead working is the default. Apply the Five Safety Rules: \n1) Disconnect completely. \n \n2) Secure against reconnection. \n \n3) Verify absence of operating voltage (test‑measure‑test where applicable). \n \n \n5 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n \n4) Apply earthing and short‑circuiting at all required points. \n \n5) Protect against adjacent live parts (screens/barriers/safe distances). \n \n• Approach distances (indicative, site‑specific): \no Live working zone: access prohibited. \n \no Vicinity zone: maintain site‑specified minimum approach distance (MAD) or erect \nbarriers; PCWA documents the control in PTW‑HV. \n \n• Barriers/screens must be fit for voltage level and environment; temporary earthing \nlocations defined in SS‑HV. \n \n5. Switching & Isolation (HV) \n• Plan: Prepare SS‑HV; identify all sources/feeds, induced/transfer potentials, \nauto‑reclose, intertrips, backfeeds (e.g., station service/aux). \n \n• Execute: Two‑person protocol (PCEI + HV‑SA). Use order/confirmation with read‑back; \nrecord time and position indications. \n \n• Visible isolation: Use withdrawable positions/visible breaks or reliable position \nindication per design; confirm in SS‑HV. \n \n• Earthing & short‑circuiting: Apply per SS‑HV at designated points using approved \ndevices; record device IDs and locations. \n \n• Zero‑voltage verification: Suitable approved instruments and methods for HV; test at \nappropriate points relative to isolations and earths. \nChange control mid‑switching: Halt at any unexpected indication; hold point; notify PCEI; do \nnot proceed until resolved. \n \n6.

Purpose \nThis add‑on standardises the format, content, review, validation and approval of Lockout \nInstructions (LI) used under WESR. It ensures consistent, high‑quality LIs that deliver a clear \nLockout Boundary, step‑by‑step isolation, zero‑energy verification, and safe restoration. \nWhere this add‑on is more stringent than baseline WESR, this add‑on prevails. Stricter local \nlaw/site rules take precedence. \n \n2. Governance & General Requirements \n• Use the WESR LI template (see Section 10) or a locally translated version that preserves \nrequired fields and sequence. \n \n• Variations are allowed for language/legal/customer needs provided required fields \nremain and intent is preserved. \n \n• Roles & independence: \no Isolation Lead (IL) develops or adapts the LI for the equipment/task. \n \no Isolation Verifier (IV) performs an independent four‑eyes review and field \nvalidation of the LI on an operationally representative unit. IL ≠ IV. \n \no Person in Charge of Electrical Installation (PCEI) (or D‑PCEI if delegated) \napproves the LI for site use and retains control of the installation during \nlockout/restore. \n \no PCWA controls the work activity and ensures briefing/sign‑on against the LI and \nassociated Safety Documents. \n \n• Where a generic LI exists, it may be used only when the equipment/options/variants \nmatch; otherwise create a site‑specific LI using the template and review/approve per this \nprocess. \n \n• Storage & searchability: LIs are kept in the site’s controlled document system with \nstandard naming (Annex A) and metadata to ensure they are easy to find by \nequipment/system. \n \n \n3 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n \n3. Components of a Lockout Instruction (LI) \nEach LI must contain, in order: \n3.1 Header (Document Identification) \nLeft (Template/Repository info) \n- Template ID/Version — reference to the WESR LI Template in use. \n- Document ID/Version — site doc number & current issue. \n- Based‑on (if applicable) — ID of the source LI used as foundation. \nCentre (Document Title) \n- Format: LI–<Equipment or System>–<Variant/Option>–<Boundary or Task> (≤ 40 \ncharacters recommended). \nExamples: LI–Converter–Mk9–Boundary, LI–OTC Crane–Gate 3–Main Isolations. \nRight (Local Approval path) \n- Developed by: initials/name (IL). \n- Reviewed by: initials/name (IV). \n- Approved by: name/role (PCEI or delegated approver). \n- Site Doc Name: <Site> – LI – <NNN>.<vv> (e.g., Horns Rev – LI – 005.00). \n- Approval Date. \n3.2 Footer \n• Safety note: “Use only the latest approved LI for this site.

This \nmust be specific and checkable. For task‑specific LIs, mark as NOT APPLICABLE and \ncontrol by the task description. \n \n• Reference documents: relevant drawings/schematics (single‑lines, P&IDs, hydraulic), \nRAMS, procedures. \n \n• Comments: concise guidance, notes, or pictures that aid correct execution. \n \n4 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n \nReviewer intent: Everything named inside the Lockout Boundary is to be verified \nzero‑energy when the LI is established. \n \n4. Purpose of LOTO (Task vs Boundary‑Based) \n• Task‑specific LI: written for a defined job or set of jobs; includes task description and \nlocations where work will occur; prerequisites and steps are tailored. \n \n• Boundary‑based LI: establishes a persistent Lockout Boundary allowing multiple tasks \nwithin that boundary; the PCWA confirms each task’s locations fall inside the boundary. \n \n• Fields: Task description; locations; (if applicable) service/work order ID; unit/asset ID. If \nnot applicable, state NOT APPLICABLE (no prefilled IDs that could mislead). \n \n5. Isolation Procedure (Structure & Content) \nRules: list the isolation and restoration as separate sequences. Each isolation point is a \nseparate step. \nFor each isolation step include: \n1) Sequence number. \n2) Isolation ID & description — device unique ID and plain‑language label. \n3) Location ID & description — panel/cabinet/valve station/physical area. \n4) Energy type & magnitude — e.g., Electrical 480 VAC, Hydraulic 160 bar, Mechanical \nrotation. \n5) Required position — e.g., LOCKED OPEN/CLOSED, LOCKED PINNED, or TAGGED where locking is \nimpossible (must be approved). \n6) Method to verify de‑energisation — e.g., three‑point test (test–measure–test) for electrical; \nvisual no‑rotation; pressure to safe level, no‑start on command. \n7) Location(s) for verification — all points where zero‑energy is to be confirmed. \n8) Method to dissipate stored energy — e.g., discharge/bonding, bleed‑down/venting, \ncooldown, gravity restraints; if none, record N/A. \n9) Isolation completed — initials/time by the Person in Charge of the LOTO after lock applied \nand zero‑energy verified. \nAfter the last isolation block, include the line “NO FURTHER ISOLATION STEPS.” \nReviewer field validation: check device identification/labels; feasibility of the position; that a \nhasp/lock can be applied; and that position cannot change while locked. \n \n \n5 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n \n6.

Partial Re‑Energisation for Testing \nUse only where required for diagnostics/testing. Controls: - Identify exactly which isolations \nwill be restored and for what purpose (reference a TEP/SfT where primary precautions vary). \n- Clear personnel, remove personal locks from affected points, establish barriers/supervision, \nand confirm communications. \n- After test, re‑isolate, dissipate energy, verify zero‑energy, and re‑apply locks/tags before \nresuming work. \n- Record each partial removal/re‑application with isolation ID, name/initials, date/time. \n \n8. Restoration Procedure \n• Provide a step‑by‑step restoration sequence that references the same isolation IDs as \nthe isolation procedure (often a different order). \n \n• For each step: Isolation ID, restore position (e.g., CLOSED/OPEN/UNPINNED), and \nrestoration completed (initials/time). \n \n• Before restoring each point, the Person in Charge of the LOTO confirms it is safe to \nre‑energise (people clear, tools removed, guards in place, temporary devices removed or \naccounted for). \n \n \n6 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n \n9. Review, Validation & Site Approval \n• Reviewer competence: Only personnel competent for the equipment/energy type (as IV) \nmay review and field‑validate LIs. \n \n• Field validation: The IV validates the LI on an operationally representative unit \nfollowing the steps, including verification and stored‑energy controls; capture photos of \nlocks/tags and device IDs. \n \n• Defects & improvements: Document deviations/suggestions within the review pack; \nresolve before site approval. \n \n• Approval: PCEI (or delegated approver) issues the approval for site use; approval \nmetadata and effective date recorded in the header. \n \n• Records: retain the review pack (comments, photos, revisions) with the controlled LI for \ntraceability; the approved LI is a clean document without tracked changes. \n \n10. Template & Document Control \n• Use WESR Lockout Instruction Template (LI‑HE‑001) or local translation that preserves \nsequence/fields. \n \n• All LIs stored in the site’s controlled repository with standard naming (Annex A). \n \n• Supersession: issue number, effective date, and change note in Version Hi",

It covers: \n• Operational activities: switching, measurement, inspection, functional checks. \n• Work activities: Dead working, working in the vicinity of live parts, and exceptional live \nwork. \nNote: High-voltage activities are governed separately and are out of scope for this Addendum. \n1.4 Roles and responsibilities (LV emphasis) \nCore WESR functions apply: \n• PREI — appoints the PCEI and sets governance. \n• PCEI — controls the installation; plans and verifies switchings and primary safety \nmeasures; issues/controls Safety Documents until restoration is complete. \n• PCWA — controls the work activity; performs the on-site risk review (RISK-W); sets \nsupplementary measures; briefs the team; clears the Safety Document. \nLV-specific LOTO functions (LV only): \n• LV Isolation Lead (LV-IL) — person in charge of LOTO on the day; executes the isolation \nplan; applies primary locks/tags; completes the Isolation & Lockout Record; coordinates \ngroup lockout. \n \n5 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n \n• LV Isolation Verifier (LV-IV) — independent verifier; performs the four-eyes check on \nisolation points, tags, and the test-measure-test results; must be different from the LV-",

Plan & manage risks (RAMS; define work boundaries; nominate PCWA and LOTO roles). \n2. Prepare the installation (Switching Schedule; four-eyes review; execute switchings; \napply LOTO; issue Safety Document). \n3. Prepare the work (PCWA conducts RISK-W; set supplementary measures; team briefing). \n4. Perform the work (controls maintained; change management applied). \n5. Restore the workplace (remove tools/screens/earthing as applicable; workers \nwithdrawn; PCWA clears). \n6. Restore the installation (PCEI returns to normal operation). \n1.7 LV safety principles (enhanced) \nA. Dead working (default) — the Five Safety Rules \n1. Disconnect completely. \n2. Secure against reconnection (locks/tags at every point of isolation). \n3. Verify absence of operating voltage using test-measure-test (instrument self-test before \nand after). \n4. Apply earthing/short-circuiting or bonding where design warrants (e.g., long cables, \nstored charge). \n \n6 \nMartin Nielsen 19-10-2025 Copyright Triquest \n \n5. Protect against adjacent live parts (barriers/screens/safe distance and, where needed, \ndedicated supervision). \nB. Minimum distances (LV) \n• Live working zone: no contact. \n• Vicinity zone: maintain ≥ 300 mm or install barriers/screens; the PCWA sets and \ndocuments the chosen control. \nC. Live work (exceptional only) \nLive LV work is not routine. If justified (e.g., measurement that cannot be performed de-\nenergised), it requires: \n• documented justification and RAMS, \n• explicit approval by the appointed authority, \n• appropriate PPE/tools/instruments and work positioning, \n• presence/controls defined by the Safety Document (often via SfT). \n1.8 LV LOTO model and independence \n• Execution: LV-IL executes the isolation plan and applies LOTO; PCEI retains control of \nthe installation. \n• Independent verification: LV-IV performs a four-eyes check of isolation points, lock/tag \nIDs, and the test-measure-test results before the PTW is issued to the PCWA. \n• Group lockout: Each LV-LU applies a personal lock at the group lock station and signs \non/off; the PCWA verifies attendance and briefings. \n• Conflict-of-interest: LV-IV must",
